# Create an /opt/pids/sinatra directory. (It seemed as good a place as any.) 
# Let a non-privileged user write to that directory, for example by executing 
# “sudo chown www-data /opt/pids/sinatra; sudo chmod 755 /opts/pids/sinatra”. 
# Make a note of what non-privileged user you use. I am just reusing www-data 
# because Apache has conveniently provided him for me and he is guaranteed to 
# not to be able to screw up anything important if he is compromised.
#
# Put this script in the same directory as your Sinatra app. Make sure the 
# scripts are readable, but not writable, by www-data. 
# (sudo chmod 755 /www/var/phone.example.com/ will accomplish 
# this: it makes only the owner able to write to it, but any user on the 
# system — including www-data — can read from it.)
